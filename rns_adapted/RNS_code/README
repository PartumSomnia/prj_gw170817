FILE		DESCRIPTION

run_grid.py		Runs the program kepler multiple times inputting parameters 
			rho_c and n from a grid.

main.c	 		Runs a sequence of rigidly rotating stars with given central
			density and polytropic index, and increasing angular momentum 
			until mass-shedding is reached. 
		
main.c_old	 	The original example program which uses the routines in
			the subsequent files. 

makefile		The makefile for the example. It will produce
			an executable named "kepler". 

sample.out		Sample output from the program kepler

equil.c 		The routines used to integrate a rapidly rotating 
			neutron star. 

equil_util.c	Some utility programs used by equil.c

nrutil.c		Numerical Recipes routines used by the program.

HEADER FILES:

consts.h		Constants used by the programs

equil.h,		Function prototypes 
equil_util.h,
