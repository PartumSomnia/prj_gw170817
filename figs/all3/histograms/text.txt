update on Dynamical Ejecta
I find that the properties of equal mass runs depend on LK/M0, and generally we get more ejecta with M0 with one exception. 
Meanwhile noVisc/Visc has a complex effect, sometimes increasing sometimes decreasing amount of ejecta, but overall smoothing out its angular distribution. 
For unequal mass binaries comparison with the old subset of runs is not directly possibe due to different masses NSs.
